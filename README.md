Overview of the project

File Handling in C++

Objective:

To demonstrate how to perform basic file operations in C++ such as writing, reading, and appending data to a text file. The program also showcases how to implement a menu-driven system to interact with the user.
Key Features:

1. Write to File:

Overwrites any existing content in the file.

User inputs data until they type "END".

2. Read from File:

Reads and displays the entire content of the file to the console.

Handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist.

3. Append to File:

Adds new data to the end of the file without deleting existing content.

User inputs data until they type "END".

4. Exit Option:

Allows the user to quit the program cleanly.

Technologies Used:

1. Programming Language: C++
2. File Handling Libraries: <fstream>
ofstream for writing and appending data.
ifstream for reading data.

How It Works:

1. Menu-Driven Interface:

Users interact with a simple text-based menu system.

They select options by entering a number corresponding to the desired operation.

2. File Handling:

The program uses file streams to interact with the file (example.txt).

It ensures data integrity by properly opening, processing, and closing files.

3. Dynamic Input Handling:

The program uses getline() to read multi-line inputs from the user.

A sentinel value (END) is used to stop data entry.

Sample Use Case:

A student wants to keep a personal journal. They can:

1. Write new entries.
2. Read all previous entries.
3. Add new thoughts to the existing journal without erasing old content.

Benefits of This Project:

1. Practical Learning:

Understands how file handling works in C++.

Demonstrates error handling for file operations.

2. Real-World Applications:

Logging systems.

Data storage and retrieval.

3. Interactive User Experience:

Provides hands-on practice with menu-driven systems.

Future Improvements:

Allow the user to specify the filename dynamically.

Add error-checking for invalid inputs in the menu.

Implement advanced features like deleting specific data from the file.
